# SMS-spam-classifier
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification.
Introduction-In this project, we aim to classify SMS messages into two categories: spam and non-spam. The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and non-spam messages. Various machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques are employed to build an accurate classifier.
Dataset-The dataset used for training and evaluation is "spam.csv". It contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.
